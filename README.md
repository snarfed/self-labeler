# self-labeler

A [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/)/[AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/)'s [labeler aka mod service](https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation) that emits the custom [self-labels](https://atproto.com/specs/label#self-labels-in-records) that already exist inside records.

Apart from the self labels built into [bsky.app](https://bsky.app/), other custom self-labels are often not displayed or handled by clients. This surfaces those labels and makes them visible.
